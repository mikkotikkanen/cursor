- When refactoring or changing code, do not remove comments or documentation and only change the parts that are required
- When writing code, only refer to functions and classes you know exist at the time of writing

# Code style
- Always follow the same code style as the adjacent code & codebase
- Use single quotes over double quotes

# Typescript
- Always write separate typings for complex parameters
- When documenting types etc. always document every prop separately

# React
- For React, always use functional React

# Next.js
- For Next.js projects, always use app router
- Add 'use client' when using components that only work on client side, such as useState
